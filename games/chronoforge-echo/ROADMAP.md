# Roadmap

- [ ] Revisit and extend each vendor’s story arc and completion milestones.
- [ ] Fix Kaida’s clipped victory pose; likely regenerate her full sprite set for consistent appearance and framing rather than replacing only the victory pose.
- [ ] Add bounded enemy patrols as the next separate encounter pass, keeping danger cues aligned with movement and routes readable.
- [ ] Revisit whether encounters should forbid retreat; undecided, keep current retreat rules until reviewed separately.
- [ ] Animate Crater Ember’s lava with a natural sense of flow and heat.
- [ ] Revisit Forest Veil’s semicircular tree groves and traversal; explore dense woodland with connected clearings and readable paths.
- [ ] Reconcile weapon types with hero archetypes and attack animations. Explore Chrono Trigger-inspired weapon families: swords for Kaida, staves for Vex, and gloves/gauntlets for Rune. Decide how existing spell foci, hammers, and shields fit, along with equipment restrictions, loot/vendor progression, and existing saves, before changing the current rules.

## TODO — Revisit Party and Inventory overlap

Inventory now has a compact crew/loadout column, a wider grid grouped by item type and sorted by descending tier, with stat deltas and Equip/Use actions inside every outlined card. Cards have bounded widths and compact icon/name headers. The crew swapper shows full portraits with names and levels on one line; it and the small character preview stay beside Equipped. Space/Enter act on items or toggle filters; [/] switch crew while preserving the selection. Filters persist during browsing and clear on click-away. Every valid consumable use in Inventory now requires confirmation.

Party remains the character record, with full stats and equipment shortcuts into Inventory. Defer the longer-term tab merger/separation decision until after using the new inventory flow; no tab removal or merger is selected.

## TODO — World traversal and exploration pacing

Revisit the time spent crossing the large regions, especially quests that send the crew from one end to the other and back. Preserve the sense of a large world while reducing empty travel. This is a future design pass, not an instruction to resize maps in the current update.

- Consider modestly compacting layouts or shortening repeated cross-region routes.
- Place useful consumable pickups and optional discoveries along quieter stretches.
- Give routes more distinctive terrain, scenery, and landmarks so each area feels different.
- Explore small optional non-combat activities or minigames that make travel more interesting without adding chores.

Judge these options by traversal time and meaningful things to discover, rather than adding filler solely to occupy space.

## Time travel — unapproved

Time travel is a **secondary postgame arc: awaiting the user's review and explicit approval after completion of the base game**. It is unavailable in this delivery. No eras, story, locations, cast, antagonists, objectives, assets, or expansion gameplay have been designed or implemented.

Development authorization is exclusively a later explicit user approval. No test, level, completion flag, or critic review grants it.

The future player eligibility contract is `campaignComplete && Kaida.level >= 40`. Both conditions are required, in either order. Eligibility alone does not make content available; this build always reports expansion availability as false.

Stable IDs, a versioned save, declarative conditions, a default-era region registry, and namespaced content registration are the only reserved seams.
