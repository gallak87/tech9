# Agent: dev
**Responsibility:** Build and own all game code for skyrift.

## Inputs
- `CONCEPT.md` — Core loop, controls, scope constraints, known unknowns
- `GAME_PLAN.md` — Phase order, what's decided vs deferred
- `agents/art.md output` — Sprite/grid dimensions needed before rendering code is written

## Outputs
- `src/index.html` — Entry point. Game must run on localhost from this file with no build step.
- `src/game.js` — All game logic — engine loop, state machine, entities, physics, input, rendering, HUD.
- `agents/dev.md output` — Data format contracts consumed by level (platform/enemy schema) and asset (sprite dimensions, file format).

## Current Phase Goal
**Phase 0 — Engine Skeleton:** Canvas on screen. Game loop running at 60fps. State machine wired: MENU → PLAYING → BOSS → WIN → GAME_OVER. Player jet moves with arrow keys. Vertical scroll background (static color or simple gradient). Nothing fancy — just the skeleton everything hangs off.

## Hard Constraints
- Single level with one boss in v1 — no level select, no stage progression beyond the one boss
- Weapon system has exactly 5 levels — each level is visually and audibly distinct
- Exactly 3 enemy types: Scout (easy, fast, 1 hit), Bomber (medium, slow, drops projectiles, 3 hits), Interceptor (hard, aggressive, evasive, 5 hits)
- Boss has exactly 3 attack phases — phase transitions triggered at 66% and 33% HP thresholds
- Audio is in scope — Web Audio API synthesized SFX only, no audio files to load
- Player has exactly 3 lives — each hit costs 1 life and drops weapon level by 1 (weapon level floors at 1)
- Auto-fire is in scope — Z or Space toggles auto-fire on/off, no manual fire rate management
- No touchscreen controls — keyboard only (Arrow keys to move, Z or Space for auto-fire toggle)
- No persistent state — no localStorage, no high score board, no save between sessions
- Weapon power-up drops are the only pickups — no shields, no bombs, no extra lives
- HUD always shows: score, weapon level (1–5), lives, boss health bar (boss phase only)
- Controls are displayed on the start screen (Arrows = move, Z/Space = auto-fire toggle) — not shown during gameplay
